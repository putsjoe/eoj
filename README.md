## Plan

- Start with reading and writing to a file, as a basic way of getting the values etc and using the input to control this.

- Look into alternatives to using a file - such as writing to memory.

- Try to maybe also write to a file as a backup, in parallel after adding and removing from the main storage/memory.

- Look at actually serving it to be used, possibly as a http server using /get/ and /set/? -- More than likely this wont be suitable and will need to look more into API.
